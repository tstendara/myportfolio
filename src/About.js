                        who has a growing passion for both front end and node. As a Software Engineer, I take great pride in bringing my own 
                        creations to life on the browser. However, with an open mind, I always make it a goal to tackle each new project with 
                        not only diligence and drive but also leaving space for improvement because I believe there is always something new to 
                        be learned. As a software engineer, I have acquired skill sets that include building applications with React, React Native, 
                        node, MySQL and other database technologies including MongoDb and Postgres. During my spare time away from coding, I rock climb, play online games, 
                        and/or I am out with my family and friends at the lake. </Typography>
